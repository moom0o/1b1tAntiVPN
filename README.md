Use my 1b1tAntiVPNv2 plugin for newer updates.

Excellent anti-vpn for my server, 1b1t. Allows non vpn players in, but players with a vpn will have to whitelist themselves and complete a recaptcha. Better than other antivpn plugins because players with vpns are still allowed. You just need to be whitelisted!


Using this for your server? Make sure to edit the code and get an api key from https://iphub.info/
